 Note: You may be wondering what the fancy syntax is here. The category on SpriteKit is just a single 32-bit integer, acting as a bitmask. This is a fancy way of saying each of the 32-bits in the integer represents a single category (and hence you can have 32 categories max). Here you're setting the first bit to indicate a monster, the next bit over to represent a projectile, and so on.
